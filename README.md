**📌 CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**


**🚀 Overview**

Customer churn is a major concern for businesses! Losing customers means losing revenue. But what if we could predict churn before it happens? 🤯This project utilizes historical customer data, analyzing factors such as usage behavior and customer demographics, to predict customer churn using powerful machine learning algorithms.


**🔍 Objective**

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that helps businesses identify customers who are likely to churn. With this insight, companies can take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce churn rates.


**📂 Dataset**

**The dataset used includes:**

Customer Demographics (Age, Gender, Location, etc.)

Service Usage Behavior (Monthly Usage, Subscription Type, Contract Duration, etc.)

Historical Churn Data (Indicates whether the customer churned or not)


**🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools**

Programming Language: Python 

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


# **Machine Learning Models:**

  -Logistic Regression 📈

  -Random Forest 🌲

  -Gradient Boosting 🌟

  -Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for experiments


# **📊 Approach**
