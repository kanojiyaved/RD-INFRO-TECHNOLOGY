# 📌 Spam Classification using ML Models

# 🔹 Internship Task 4 | RD INFO TECHNOLOGY

# 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting spam messages using machine learning techniques. By utilizing TF-IDF and word embeddings, we train models like Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify messages as spam or ham (not spam).

# 🔍 Tech Stack & Tools Used

✅ Python 🐍

✅ Scikit-Learn 📊

✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP) ✨

✅ TF-IDF Vectorizer 🔢

✅ Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) 🧠

✅ Matplotlib 📊 (for data visualization)

✅ Machine Learning Models (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)

# 💡 Project Highlights

📌 Preprocessed text data for better model accuracy

📌 Implemented TF-IDF & word embeddings for feature extraction

📌 Compared ML classifiers to find the best-performing model

📌 Achieved high accuracy in spam detection

# 🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ Load & preprocess the dataset 🗂️

2️⃣ Convert text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF / Word Embeddings

3️⃣ Train classifiers like Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM

4️⃣ Predict whether a message is spam or ham 📨

# 📢 Results & Insights

✔️ Model Comparison: Analyzed accuracy, precision, and recall
