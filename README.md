**Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset containing transaction details, I experimented with different classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

This project is part of my internship at RD INFRO TECHNOLOGY.

**📂 Dataset**

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction records, with features representing transaction attributes. The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

**⚙️ Technologies Used**

  -Python 

 -Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

 -Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)

 -Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

 -Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

 -📊 Machine Learning Models Implemented

 -SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

 -Logistic Regression

 -Decision Trees

 -Random Forest

**🏆 Results & Insights**

Analyzed the dataset to identify key patterns in fraudulent transactions.

Random Forest showed the best performance in terms of detecting fraud while minimizing false positives.

**📌 Future Improvements**

   -Try advanced techniques like XGBoost or Neural Networks.

   -Implement real-time fraud detection using streaming data.

   -Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning.
